# Distribution Strategies Guide

## Overview

PostLink API supports **three distribution strategies** for allocating send requests to deliverers. Each strategy can be configured without writing any code by simply changing the `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY` environment variable.

## Quick Configuration

### Environment Variable
```bash
# In your .env file
DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=round_robin    # Default strategy
# OR
DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=least_loaded   # Alternative strategy  
# OR
DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=random         # Alternative strategy
```

### Config File
**Location**: `config/capacity.php`
```php
'distribution_strategy' => env('DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY', 'round_robin'),
```

**No code changes required** - just update your environment variable and restart the application.

## Available Strategies

### 1. Round Robin Strategy 🔄

**Configuration**: `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=round_robin`

**How It Works**: 
Deliverers receive requests in sequential, rotating order using a persistent cache-based index.

**Implementation**:
```php
case 'round_robin':
    return $this->roundRobinService->getNextDeliverer($availableDeliveries);
```

**Example Flow**:
```
Deliverers Available: [A, B, C]

Request 1 → Deliverer A (index: 0)
Request 2 → Deliverer B (index: 1)  
Request 3 → Deliverer C (index: 2)
Request 4 → Deliverer A (index: 3 % 3 = 0)
Request 5 → Deliverer B (index: 4 % 3 = 1)
```

#### ✅ Pros:
- **Perfect Fairness**: Every deliverer gets exactly equal opportunities over time
- **Predictable Distribution**: Systematic rotation ensures no deliverer is skipped
- **Load Balancing**: Prevents any single deliverer from being overwhelmed
- **State Persistence**: Uses cache to maintain fair rotation across application restarts
- **Ideal for Equal Service Levels**: Great when all deliverers have similar capabilities

#### ❌ Cons:
- **Ignores Current Load**: Doesn't consider how busy each deliverer currently is
- **No Performance Optimization**: May assign to slower deliverers when faster ones are available
- **Cache Dependency**: Requires cache system to maintain rotation state
- **Fixed Order**: Cannot adapt to changing deliverer performance or availability patterns
- **Potential Inefficiency**: May assign work to busy deliverers while idle ones wait

#### 🎯 Best For:
- **Equal Opportunity Platforms**: When fair distribution is more important than efficiency
- **Stable Deliverer Pool**: When deliverers have similar performance characteristics  
- **Predictable Workloads**: When request patterns are consistent
- **Compliance Requirements**: When you need to prove fair treatment of all deliverers

### 2. Least Loaded Strategy ⚖️

**Configuration**: `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=least_loaded` (also the fallback default)

**How It Works**:
Always assigns requests to the deliverer with the **fewest active responses**, optimizing for system efficiency.

**Implementation**:
```php
case 'least_loaded':
default:
    // Sort by current load (least loaded first)
    $sortedDeliveries = $availableDeliveries->sortBy(function($delivery) {
        return $this->getDelivererActiveResponses($delivery->user_id);
    });
    return $sortedDeliveries->first();
```

**Example Flow**:
```
Current Loads:
- Deliverer A: 0 active responses
- Deliverer B: 1 active response  
- Deliverer C: 2 active responses

Request 1 → Deliverer A (0 responses - least loaded)
Request 2 → Deliverer A (1 response) or B (1 response) - first in sort
Request 3 → Deliverer B (1 response - still least loaded)
```

#### ✅ Pros:
- **Maximum Efficiency**: Always uses the most available deliverers first
- **Optimal Resource Utilization**: Minimizes idle time while preventing overload
- **Responsive to Workload**: Adapts automatically to varying deliverer availability
- **Performance Focused**: Prioritizes system throughput over perfect equality
- **Self-Balancing**: Naturally distributes load based on deliverer capacity
- **No State Required**: Doesn't need cache or persistent state tracking

#### ❌ Cons:
- **Potential Unfairness**: Fast deliverers may get more opportunities than slow ones
- **Starvation Risk**: Slow deliverers might receive fewer requests if they stay busy longer
- **Load Calculation Overhead**: Requires counting active responses for each deliverer
- **Favors Fast Performers**: May create inequality in earning opportunities
- **Less Predictable**: Distribution pattern depends on deliverer response times

#### 🎯 Best For:
- **Performance-Critical Systems**: When speed and efficiency are paramount
- **Variable Deliverer Performance**: When deliverers have different capabilities/speeds
- **High-Volume Operations**: When maximizing throughput is essential  
- **Dynamic Environments**: When deliverer availability changes frequently
- **Cost Optimization**: When minimizing response times reduces operational costs

### 3. Random Strategy 🎲

**Configuration**: `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=random`

**How It Works**:
Randomly selects any available deliverer with capacity, providing unpredictable but statistically fair distribution.

**Implementation**:
```php
case 'random':
    return $availableDeliveries->random();
```

**Example Flow**:
```
Available Deliverers: [A, B, C]

Request 1 → Deliverer B (random selection)
Request 2 → Deliverer A (random selection)  
Request 3 → Deliverer B (random selection)
Request 4 → Deliverer C (random selection)
Request 5 → Deliverer A (random selection)
```

#### ✅ Pros:
- **Unpredictable Patterns**: No deliverer can game the system or predict assignments
- **Statistically Fair**: Over large samples, distribution approaches equality
- **Simple Implementation**: Minimal computational overhead
- **No State Management**: Doesn't require persistent tracking or cache
- **Gaming Prevention**: Impossible to manipulate or exploit the system
- **Testing Friendly**: Great for load testing and chaos engineering

#### ❌ Cons:
- **Short-Term Unfairness**: May assign multiple consecutive requests to same deliverer
- **No Optimization**: Ignores both current load and rotation fairness
- **Unpredictable Service**: Users cannot expect consistent response patterns
- **Potential Clustering**: Random distribution can create uneven bursts
- **No Business Logic**: Doesn't align with any specific business optimization goals
- **Difficult to Monitor**: Hard to predict or analyze distribution patterns

#### 🎯 Best For:
- **Testing Environments**: Perfect for load testing and system validation
- **Anti-Gaming Systems**: When preventing manipulation is critical
- **Simple Requirements**: When you need basic distribution without specific optimization
- **Research/Analytics**: When studying system behavior under random conditions  
- **Temporary Setups**: Quick setup without complex distribution logic

## Monitoring Distribution Effectiveness

### Metrics to Track

**For All Strategies:**
- Distribution fairness (requests per deliverer over time)
- Average response time per strategy
- Deliverer satisfaction and retention rates
- System throughput and efficiency metrics

**Round Robin Specific:**
```bash
# Check round-robin state
php artisan tinker
$service = app(\App\Services\Matching\RoundRobinDistributionService::class);
$state = $service->getDistributionState();
```

**Least Loaded Specific:**
```bash
# Monitor capacity utilization
GET /api/dev/capacity/{deliverer_id}
```

**Random Specific:**
```sql
-- Check distribution randomness over time
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as request_count, 
       AVG(created_at) as avg_time
FROM responses 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY request_count DESC;
```

## Migration Between Strategies

### Strategy Changes Take Effect:
- **Immediately** for new requests after application restart/config reload
- **No data migration required** - existing responses remain unchanged
- **Historical data preserved** - all analytics remain valid

### Best Practices for Strategy Changes:
1. **Monitor Impact**: Track metrics before and after changes
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Test with small percentage of traffic first  
3. **Rollback Plan**: Keep previous strategy config for quick revert
4. **Communication**: Notify deliverers if distribution patterns will change significantly

## Advanced Configuration

### Combining with Capacity Management
```bash
# High-capacity least-loaded system
DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY=least_loaded
DELIVERER_MAX_CAPACITY=5
REBALANCING_ENABLED=true

# Fair low-capacity round-robin system
